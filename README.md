# List of Publicly Available Pain Recognition Databases
This is a list of pain recognition databases that are publicly available for research.
It has been started as part of the paper "Automatic Recognition Methods Supporting Pain Assessment: A Survey" \[[IEEEXplore](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2946774) | [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336447252)\] to provide an overview on related databases and how to obtain them.
The idea is to update this page whenever a new database is available or a database website URLs changes.
Any contribution is welcome!
